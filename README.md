STM32ToArduino is a driver which is used to program stm32 as if you were programming Arduino making the whole process shorter.
7segment combinations is a driver I used to instantly print numbers on a 7 segment display by calling a number() function instead of manually setting pins to HIGH or LOW in the code every signle time.
7segmentCounter is just a test to see if it works correctly.
